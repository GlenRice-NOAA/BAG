
This directory contains the binary distribution of HDF5-1.6.5 that 
was compiled on Linux 2.4 with gcc 3.2.3 and pgf90.  It contains HDF5 
APIs for:  C, C++ and F90

The contents of this directory are:

    COPYING     - Copyright notice
    README      - This file
    RELEASE.txt - Detailed information regarding this release
    bin/        - Directory containing HDF5 pre-compiled utilities 
    examples/   - Example programs
    include/    - Directory containing HDF5 include files
    lib/        - Directory containing HDF5 libraries and settings 

These binaries were built with, but do NOT include the ZLIB and 
SZIP (version 2.0, Encoder ENABLED) external libraries.   

As a convenience we provide the ZLIB and SZIP binaries and source
code on our ftp server at:

   ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/lib-external/

The official ZLIB and SZIP pages are at:

   ZLIB: http://www.zlib.org/
   SZIP: http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/doc_resource/SZIP/
       
Be sure to add the path to the SZIP shared library to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
If using the shared HDF5 libraries you will also need to add the path to 
the HDF5 shared library to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.  

We provide scripts for compiling applications with the HDF5 libraries:

    bin/h5cc  - for C
    bin/h5fc  - for F90 (if Fortran 90 is included with the binaries)
    bin/h5c++ - for C++ (if C++ is included with the binaries) 

After you have installed the binaries to their final destination,
you can use these scripts (h5cc, h5fc, h5c++) to compile.  However,
you must first:  

  1) Run ./h5redeploy to change site specific paths in the scripts. 

  2) Edit each script and update the paths for the external libraries 
     in LDFLAGS and CPPFLAGS.

You may also need to change other variables in the scripts, depending 
on how things are set up on your system.  Here are some of the variables 
to check:

  prefix      - Path to the HDF5 top level installation directory
  CCBASE      - Name of the alternative C compiler
  CLINKERBASE - Name of the alternative linker
  LIBS        - Libraries your application will link with
 
For information on settings used to build these HDF5 libraries, please 
refer to: 

    ./lib/libhdf5.settings 
    ./lib/libhdf5_fortran.settings (if Fortran enabled)  
    ./lib/libhdf5_cpp.settings (if C++ enabled)

For further details refer to the INSTALL files in the ./release_docs/ 
directory of the HDF5 source code:

    ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/HDF5/current/src/unpacked/release_docs/

Source code can be found on the NCSA ftp server in:
