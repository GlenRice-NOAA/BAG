These are the core source library files from HDF5 1.8.5patch1, for use with the BAG library, primarily for compile and link for windows platforms. Files, examples and documentation that were not relevent for compile on windows were removed. Other platforms use source from another sub-directory or a compressed file. Configuration headers and source files are hard-coded. Configuration files were edited to remove the dependency on szip, and remove a global timezone reference.
