   =======
   
This directory contains a number of external libraries which are used
by the Open Navigation Surface project. While you can download and
build them all separately they are included here with supporting build
files in order to make it easier to get a quick start. It is possible
to substitute other versions or completely different libraries as long
as they maintain the same calling interface.

Be aware that the xerces-c library requires an environment variable to be set.
