BAG v.1.6.0 Release Notes
=========================

June 10, 2016.
1.  Addition of optional layers and API functionality to support
variable-resolution grids in BAGs, along with a fixed resolution
mandatory layer, intended to be an approximate version of the
variable-resolution data.
2.  Addition of bagViewer application.  Note that since this requires
Qt libraries, it is an optional build in the CMake system.  This needs
to be turned on manually in the CMake GUI.
3.  Updates to allow for code build on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.
4.  Modifications to build on Linux Mint.
5.  Added missing BAG file examples from NAVO.
6.  Updates to sections of the FSD to reflect changes since it was
drafted.  Addition of documentation for BAG-VR implementation as a
separate document.
7.  Updates to library versions of HDF5 (1.8.17) and libXML2 (2.9.4) to
allow for cleaner builds on MSVS 2015.
8.  Minor fixes to CMake system to handle installation better.
